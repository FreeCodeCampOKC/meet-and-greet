### Ameya Joshi
Hello everyone! I am looking to land a permanent position as a front-end developer. I have extensive experience working with HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript and the jQuery library. More recently I have also become comfortable working with Git/GitHub. I can work comfortably in a team setting and individually, and have proven my ability to complete projects from start to finish. Last year, I completed the Free Code Camp front-end course and achieved my FCC [Front-End Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/coderaj7470/legacy-front-end). Take a look at my [portfolio](http://www.coderaj7470.com), where you will find all of my work and code examples, including a website that I have been upkeeping for several years! Currently, I am learning React, CSS Grid and Sass and I am always up for expanding my knowledge. If you would like to see more, you can view my [GitHub](https://github.com/CoderAJ7470), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/CoderAJ/#) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coderaj7470) pages.
